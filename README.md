👋 Hi, I'm Dominik!

📚 Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at the University of Media in Stuttgart. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and exploring the intersection of business and IT.

💻 My Coding Arsenal:
- Most experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Dabbling in C++ for more intricate projects.
- Dabbling in Groovy for automation and scripting.

🚀 **Key Projects:**
1. **Conan:** Actively working with Conan, a C/C++ package manager. Ensuring seamless dependency management and efficient builds.

2. **DatingSite Web Application:** As part of a study project, I spearheaded the development of a modern and dynamic web application for a dating site. Leveraging my skills in Python and JavaScript, I employed the Flask web framework, Flask-Restx for efficient API development, React for the front end, and MySQL for robust data storage.

3. **Amazon Reviews Request Application:** Currently, I'm immersed in the development of a cutting-edge application designed to streamline the automation process of requesting reviews on Amazon, powered by the Amazon Selling Partner API (SP API).
