üëã Hi, I'm Dominik!  

üìö **Business Informatics Enthusiast**  
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at the University of Media in Stuttgart, with an expected graduation in July 2025. I thrive at the intersection of business and IT, leveraging my skills to create efficient, scalable, and impactful technological solutions.  

üíª **Tech Stack Highlights**  
- **Languages:** Python (most experienced), JavaScript, C++, and some Swift.  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, React, Conan and Tart (virtualization for CI/CD).  
- **Tooling:** Groovy for automation scripting and good experience with Conan for dependency management.  
- **APIs:** Proficient with the Amazon SP API for e-commerce integrations.  
- **Machine Learning:** Moderate experience, including building models for emotion detection, fall detection, and wine quality prediction (using the SciKit dataset).  

üöÄ **Notable Projects**  
- **Conan Dependency Management:** Ensuring efficient builds and seamless dependency management for C/C++ projects. Mainly worked on transition recipes from Conan 1.x to Conan 2.x.
- **Dating Site Web Application:** Development of a dynamic web app leveraging Python (Flask), Flask-Restx for APIs, React for the front end, and MySQL for backend storage.
