üëã Hi, I'm Dominik!  

üìö **Business Informatics Enthusiast**  
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at the University of Media in Stuttgart, with an expected graduation in July 2025. I thrive at the intersection of business and IT, leveraging my skills to create efficient, scalable, and impactful technological solutions.  

üíª **Tech Stack Highlights**  
- **Languages:** Python (most experienced), JavaScript, C++, and some Swift.  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, React, Conan and Tart (virtualization for CI/CD).  
- **Tooling:** Groovy for automation scripting and good experience with Conan for dependency management.  
- **APIs:** Proficient with the Amazon SP API for e-commerce integrations.  
- **Machine Learning:** Moderate experience, including building models for emotion detection, fall detection, and wine quality prediction (using the SciKit dataset).  

üöÄ **Notable Projects**  
- **Conan Dependency Management:** Ensuring efficient builds and seamless dependency management for C/C++ projects. Mainly worked on transition recipes from Conan 1.x to Conan 2.x.
- **Dating Site Web Application:** Development of a dynamic web app leveraging Python (Flask), Flask-Restx for APIs, React for the front end, and MySQL for backend storage.  
- **Amazon Reviews Request Automation:** Developing an innovative tool to automate review requests using Amazon SP API, optimizing sellers‚Äô workflows.  
- **Shopify-Amazon Plugin Integration:** Currently building a software plugin to synchronize reviews from Amazon listings to Shopify stores, enhancing e-commerce experiences.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Emotion Detection: Developed a real-time model to detect facial expressions using a camera.  
  - Fall Detection: Built a model to identify if a person is falling, standing, or lying down.  
  - Wine Quality Prediction: Utilized the SciKit dataset to predict wine quality with machine learning algorithms.  

üåü **Additional Skills and Experience**  
- Hands-on experience with **Tart** virtualization for streamlining CI/CD pipelines, integrating Bitbucket, Jenkins, and Artifactory.  
- Moderate exposure to **Swift**, showcasing versatility in adapting to new technologies.  
- Passionate about clean, efficient code and continuously seeking optimization opportunities in software development.
